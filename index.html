    <h1>Privacy Policy for Contextual Translation Chrome Extension</h1>

    <p><em>Last updated: Dec 3, 2023</em></p>

    <p>Thank you for using the Contextual Translation Chrome Extension ("Extension"). This Privacy Policy is designed to
        help you understand how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Extension.</p>

    <p>By installing and using the Contextual Translation Chrome Extension, you agree to the terms outlined in this
        Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, please do not use the Extension.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Voluntarily Submitted Information</h3>

    <p>The Contextual Translation Chrome Extension allows users to voluntarily submit HTML content for
        translation purposes. This information is collected only when you choose to use the "upload page" feature
        provided by the Extension.</p>

    <h3>Usage Data</h3>

    <p>We may also collect non-personal information about how the Extension is used, such as the frequency and
        duration of usage, the features accessed, and other similar data. This helps us improve the functionality and
        performance of the Extension.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <h3>Translation Service</h3>

    <p>The primary purpose of collecting HTML content is to provide you with a seamless translation
        experience. The Extension transfers this information to the Guidewire Globalization Team's servers for
        processing and to generate translation memory to reduce translation costs.</p>

    <h2>Information Sharing</h2>

    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to third parties. Your
        voluntarily submitted HTML contents are transferred to the Guidewire Globalization Team's servers for processing.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>

    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information submitted to us. However, it's important to note that no
        method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use
        commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>

    <p>You have the option to uninstall the Contextual Translation Chrome Extension at any time if you no longer wish
        to use it.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the
        updated policy on this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any
        changes.</p>
